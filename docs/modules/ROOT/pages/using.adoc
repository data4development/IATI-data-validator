= Using the validator

The validator can be run as a Docker container, with all the required software and libraries included.

This page documents the main use cases.

. Run the validator on a local machine, using local files.
. Run the validator as a stand-alone service.
. Run the validator in a cluster, as a batch processor.
. Run the validator in a cluster, as a service.

The validator uses a _workspace_ volume, with folders `src`, `dest`, `tmp`, et  cetera for artifacts.

== Run the validator on a local machine

It is possible to bind the volume mount point to a local folder, to work with local files.

For example, to use your current directory:

[source,bash]
----
docker run --rm \
  -u=`id -u`:`id -g` \
  -v `pwd`:/workspace \
  data4development/iati-data-validator
----

This will show the available _targets_ in the system, using the local folder as  a workspace.

Using an alias will make it easier to use the targets:

[source,bash]
----
alias iati-validator='docker run --rm -u=`id -u`:`id -g` -v `pwd`:/workspace data4development/iati-data-validator'
----

=== Initialise the local workspace in the current folder.

----
iati-validator init
----

=== Add the raw input files to the folder `input`, and create the feedback files:

----
iati-validator feedback
----

. This will run `xml-check` to check whether the XML files are well-formed and validate  according to the IATI schema, and put the files in the `src` folder.
. Next, it will run `rules` to apply the validation rules to the these files, to create  the feedback files in the `dest` folder.

=== Create JSON and SVRL versions of the feedback files

----
iati-validator json
iati-validator svrl
----

The files will be put in the `json` and `svrl` folders.

=== Create a static HTML page with feedback

----
iati-validator report
----

The reports will be available as `report/<filename>.feedback.html`.
